  # Onboarding step 1: Baby's First Ingredient

  Hey, remember when you'd step on a LEGO brick at 3 AM and question all your life choices?
  Ingredients in [railsnew.io](https://railsnew.io) are like those tiny LEGO pieces ‚Äì without the step-on-a-brick-and-invent-new-curse-words part.
  More formally: [railsnew.io](https://railsnew.io) ingredients are [Rails application templates](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/rails_application_templates.html) on steroids.
  There's a crucial difference, though:
  * Typical Rails application templates are a kitchen sink of features, aiming to generate a Rails application in one-shot.
  * [railsnew.io](https://railsnew.io) ingredients are like LEGO bricks: each piece does ONE. SPECIFIC. THING.
  One ingredient = one superpower. Maybe it's adding a gem. Maybe it's configuring something.
  Whatever it is, it's focused like a cat chasing a laser pointer.
  You then combine many ingredients to build your Rails application - more on that later.
