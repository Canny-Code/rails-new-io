      Onboarding step 1: Baby's first ingredient
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Ingreditents are the atomic building blocks of your new Rails application.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      You can think of ingredients as <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v8.0/rails_application_templates.html" class="text-blue-500">Rails application templates</a> on steroids.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Unlike typical 'kitchen sink' Rails application templates, you should strive to keep your ingredients as simple as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Why?
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Because you are going to combine many ingredients together to create a Rails application.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      The simpler your ingredients are, the easier it is to reuse and combine them together.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Typical ingredients have just a few (or even one) line(s) of code, and are focused on a single task - like adding a gem.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Okay, let's get started! Start by creating your first ingredient - follow the steps in the sidebar.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500 font-bold">
      ⚠️ Use the exact strings as shown in the sidebar, otherwise the onboarding will not work properly!
