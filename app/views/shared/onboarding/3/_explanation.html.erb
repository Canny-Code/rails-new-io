  # Onboarding step 3: Your Recipe Collection
  If ingredients are your LEGO bricks, then recipes are your LEGO building plans.
  Except instead of "Insert Brick A into Slot B", you're combining Rails CLI flags and ingredients to create a blueprint for your Rails app.

  **What are we crafting?**
  A tasty recipe with:
  * Tailwind CSS
  * Built-in Rails authentication with some extra bells and whistles
  * RSpec (tbh Minitest is our preferred flavor, but hey, 1) this is a demo, 2) RSpec is a popular choice, so what the hell)

  Your recipe collection is looking pretty lonely right now. Let's do something about it!
