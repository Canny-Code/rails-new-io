  # Onboarding step 6: Name That App!
  Oh yeah, plot twist: railsnew.io is gonna push this baby straight to GitHub when it's done generatingt the app.
  Thus, your app name needs to be:
  * Valid for GitHub (so maybe skip 'my_awesome_$$_app!!!')
  * Not already camping in your GitHub repos (check for that green "✓ Name is available" below)

  ⏭️ **Next Step**: Smash that 'Generate App' button once you see the green checkmark →
