  # Onboarding step 2: Your First Ingredient!

  Nice work on your first ingredient!
  Like snapping together your first two LEGO bricks – not exactly mind-blowing, but hey, every masterpiece starts somewhere, right?

  Nothing to actually do here (we just wanted to maintain the normal flow of the process).
  Let's move on to the next thing: **Recipes**.
  Think of recipes as your LEGO instruction manual, except instead of building a plastic Death Star, you're crafting your Rails dream app.
  ⏭️ **Next Step**: Click the **My Recipes** link in the top navigation bar to keep this party rolling →
