      Onboarding step 4: Creating your first recipe!
    </h1>
    <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Exciting times ahead - you are ready to create your first recipe, using the ingredient created in step 1 - and some others.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Let's create a new Recipe with Tailwind CSS, built in Rails authentication (with some extra goodies), and RSpec instead of Minitest.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500">
      Btw. we are fans of Minitest + fixtures at railsnew.io, so this is not an endorsement of RSpec - or anything, really. But that is exactly the point: you can mix and match ingredients (or replace them in an existing recipe) to create your own custom Rails experience.
